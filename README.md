# Detailed Core Scheduling Simulator

This was made to deepen my understanding of core process scheduling, it can take a variety of inputs and determine the completion times of the processes when scheduled for CPU access.

to compile this code:

use "g++ main.cpp -o [name]"

then "./[name] < input##.txt"

Or, just enable the readfromfile function and hard code your input files.
